<strong>Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform.</strong>
One bonus of using JS is the fact that you get an all-around language. But, the real reasons for using scripting language (JS) as Backend, could be: <br>
The easy accesiabilty for new packages using NPM.<br>
One all around language.

<strong>Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using for
example Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat</strong>
The POJO/Objects, differences.
Simplicity of the servers

<strong>Node.js uses a Single Threaded Non-blocking strategy to handle asynchronous task. Explain strategies to
implement a Node.js based server architecture that still could take advantage of a multi-core Server.</strong>


<strong>Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to the testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript +
relevant packages</strong> 
Check the included test in the "testAPI" folder. (Missing some stuff, troubleshooting)

<strong>Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.</strong>
Check the app.js class.

<strong>Explain, using relevant examples, how to implement sessions, and the legal implications of doing this.</strong>
Check the app.js class, and relevant cookie(EU) laws.

<strong>Compare the express strategy toward (server side) templating with the one you used with Java on second
semester.</strong>

<strong>Explain, using a relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express and show
how you can "test" all the four CRUD operations programmatically using for example the Request package.</strong>
Check the jokesAPI and testAPI folder.

<strong>Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages (Mocha etc.) and how to
test asynchronous code.</strong>
Check testAPI, and look for the Mocha/Chai requires and usages.

<strong>Explain, using relevant examples, different ways to mock out databases, HTTP-request etc.</strong>
Check the MockTest.js class.
